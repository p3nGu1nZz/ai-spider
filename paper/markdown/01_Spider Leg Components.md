## 1. Introduction

Spiders possess a unique locomotion system that differs significantly from that of vertebrates. Their legs are composed of multiple segments connected by joints, allowing for intricate movements and adaptability to various terrains. Accurately modeling this anatomy is crucial for simulating realistic spider behavior in virtual environments. This paper outlines the specifications for constructing spider leg models in Unity, focusing on anatomical accuracy, biomechanical function, and practical implementation details.

## 2. Anatomical Overview of Spider Legs

### 2.1 General Structure

Each spider leg consists of seven distinct segments connected by six joints. The segments, in order from the body to the tip, are:

1. **Coxa (C):** Connects the leg to the spider's body.
2. **Trochanter (Tr):** Acts as a hinge between the coxa and femur.
3. **Femur (F):** The longest segment, providing leverage.
4. **Patella (P):** Functions like a knee.
5. **Tibia (Ti):** Provides additional extension.
6. **Metatarsus (Mt):** Part of the foot structure.
7. **Tarsus (Ta):** Terminates the leg with claws.

### 2.2 Segment Descriptions

#### 2.2.1 Coxa (C)

- **Function:** Serves as the pivot point for leg movement.
- **Movement:** Primarily enables forward and backward motion.
- **Biomechanics:** Supports vertical lifting and rotation within a limited range.

#### 2.2.2 Trochanter (Tr)

- **Function:** Provides additional rotational capability.
- **Movement:** Allows vertical and lateral adjustments.
- **Biomechanics:** Functions as a hinge, enhancing leg flexibility.

#### 2.2.3 Femur (F)

- **Function:** Offers the main leverage for leg extension.
- **Movement:** Facilitates substantial vertical and horizontal reach.
- **Biomechanics:** Critical for generating movement force.

## 3. Biomechanical Modeling in Unity

### 3.1 Kinematic Chain Representation

The spider leg can be represented as a kinematic chain, where each segment is a link connected by joints. This chain enables the calculation of leg positions and orientations using forward kinematics.

#### 3.1.1 Forward Kinematics Equations

For each leg, the position of the end effector (tarsus) can be calculated using the transformation matrices of each segment:

\[
T_{\text{total}} = T_C \cdot T_{Tr} \cdot T_F \cdot T_P \cdot T_{Ti} \cdot T_{Mt} \cdot T_{Ta}
\]

Where:
- \( T_{\text{segment}} \) is the transformation matrix for each segment.

### 3.2 Segment Lengths and Angles

#### 3.2.1 Standardized Measurements

Assuming a standardized unit system (e.g., meters or Unity units), the segments have the following lengths:

- **Coxa (L_C):** 0.5 units
- **Trochanter (L_{Tr}):** 0.2 units
- **Femur (L_F):** 1.0 units
- **Patella (L_P):** 0.3 units
- **Tibia (L_{Ti}):** 0.8 units
- **Metatarsus (L_{Mt}):** 0.4 units
- **Tarsus (L_{Ta}):** 0.2 units

#### 3.2.2 Joint Angle Constraints

Each joint has a specific range of motion (ROM) to mimic biological limitations:

- **Coxa-Trochanter (\( \theta_{CT} \)):** \(-30^\circ\) to \(+30^\circ\)
- **Trochanter-Femur (\( \theta_{TF} \)):** \(-20^\circ\) to \(+20^\circ\)
- **Femur-Patella (\( \theta_{FP} \)):** \(-60^\circ\) to \(+60^\circ\)
- **Patella-Tibia (\( \theta_{PT} \)):** \(-40^\circ\) to \(+40^\circ\)
- **Tibia-Metatarsus (\( \theta_{TM} \)):** \(-50^\circ\) to \(+50^\circ\)
- **Metatarsus-Tarsus (\( \theta_{MT} \)):** \(-15^\circ\) to \(+15^\circ\)

### 3.3 Mathematical Representation

#### 3.3.1 Transformation Matrices

Each segment's transformation can be represented using homogeneous transformation matrices that account for rotation and translation.

For segment \( i \):

\[
T_i = \begin{bmatrix}
R_i & d_i \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Where:
- \( R_i \) is the rotation matrix derived from joint angles.
- \( d_i \) is the displacement vector along the segment's length.

#### 3.3.2 Rotation Matrices

Rotation matrices are constructed based on the permissible axes of rotation for each joint.

For a joint rotating about axis \( \alpha \):

\[
R(\theta, \alpha) = \text{Rotation matrix about axis } \alpha \text{ by angle } \theta
\]

## 4. Implementation in Unity

### 4.1 Hierarchical Model Setup

Create a parent-child hierarchy for each leg within Unity's GameObject structure:

- **Leg Root (Coxa):** Attached to the spider's body.

## 5. Mathematical Modeling

### 5.1 Kinematic Equations

Define the position \( \mathbf{P}_{\text{Ta}} \) of the tarsus (end effector) relative to the body:

\[
\mathbf{P}_{\text{Ta}} = \mathbf{P}_C + \sum_{i=C}^{Ta} R_{\text{total}}^{(i)} \cdot \mathbf{L}_i
\]

Where:

- \( \mathbf{P}_C \) is the position of the coxa.
- \( R_{\text{total}}^{(i)} = \prod_{j=C}^{i} R_j \) is the cumulative rotation matrix up to segment \( i \).
- \( \mathbf{L}_i \) is the local vector of segment \( i \).

### 5.2 Dynamics and Control

Use Newton-Euler methods to calculate the dynamics of each segment:

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i
\]
\[
\mathbf{\tau}_i = I_i \cdot \mathbf{\alpha}_i + \mathbf{\omega}_i \times (I_i \cdot \mathbf{\omega}_i)
\]

Where:

- \( \mathbf{F}_i \) is the force on segment \( i \).
- \( m_i \) is the mass.
- \( \mathbf{a}_i \) is the linear acceleration.
- \( \mathbf{\tau}_i \) is the torque.
